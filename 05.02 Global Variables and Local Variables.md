In Python, the distinction between global and local variables within functions is crucial for understanding variable scope and how data is accessed and modified.

### Local Variables

**Definition:** A local variable is a variable that is defined *inside* a function. It is only accessible from within that function. Its scope is limited to the function in which it is created.

**Lifetime:** Local variables are created when the function is called and are destroyed once the function finishes executing (or returns).

**Characteristics:**

  * You cannot access a local variable from outside the function. If you try, you'll get a `NameError`.
  * Different calls to the same function create new instances of its local variables.
  * If a variable with the same name exists globally, the local variable will "shadow" or take precedence over the global one *within* the function.

**Example:**

```python
def my_function():
    local_var = "I am a local variable"
    print(local_var)

my_function()
# print(local_var)  # This would raise a NameError because local_var is not defined globally
```

### Global Variables

**Definition:** A global variable is a variable that is defined *outside* of any function. It is accessible from anywhere in the program, both inside and outside of functions.

**Lifetime:** Global variables are created when the program starts and exist until the program terminates.

**Characteristics:**

  * You can read the value of a global variable from inside a function without any special keywords.
  * To *modify* a global variable from inside a function, you must explicitly declare it as `global` within the function using the `global` keyword. If you don't, Python will create a new local variable with the same name, shadowing the global one.

**Example (Reading Global Variable):**

```python
global_var = "I am a global variable"

def my_function():
    print(global_var)  # Accessing the global variable

my_function()
print(global_var)
```

**Example (Modifying Global Variable using `global` keyword):**

```python
global_count = 0

def increment_count():
    global global_count  # Declare global_count as global
    global_count += 1
    print(f"Inside function: global_count = {global_count}")

print(f"Before function call: global_count = {global_count}")
increment_count()
print(f"After first function call: global_count = {global_count}")
increment_count()
print(f"After second function call: global_count = {global_count}")
```

**Example (Shadowing - Incorrect attempt to modify global without `global`):**

```python
global_message = "Hello"

def change_message():
    global_message = "Goodbye"  # This creates a new LOCAL variable named global_message
    print(f"Inside function: {global_message}")

print(f"Before function call: {global_message}")
change_message()
print(f"After function call: {global_message}") # global_message remains "Hello"
```

In the last example, `global_message` inside `change_message` is a *local* variable. The global `global_message` remains unchanged because the `global` keyword was not used.

### Summary of Key Differences:

| Feature      | Local Variable                       | Global Variable                                     |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope** | Within the function it's defined in. | Throughout the entire program.                      |
| **Lifetime** | Created on function call, destroyed on function exit. | Created on program start, exists until program end. |
| **Access** | Only from within its function.       | From anywhere in the program.                       |
| **Modification** | Direct.                          | Requires `global` keyword inside a function.        |

### Best Practices:

  * **Minimize Global Variable Usage:** While convenient, over-reliance on global variables can lead to code that is harder to debug, test, and maintain. It creates "hidden" dependencies between different parts of your program.
  * **Pass Arguments and Return Values:** For better code organization and clarity, it's generally recommended to pass data into functions as arguments and return results. This makes the data flow explicit.
  * **Use Global Variables Sparingly for Constants:** Global variables can be useful for defining constants that are used throughout your application (e.g., `PI = 3.14159`).
  * **Clarity with `global`:** If you *must* modify a global variable inside a function, always use the `global` keyword to make your intent clear.

Understanding global and local variables is fundamental to writing correct and predictable Python code, especially as your programs grow in complexity.
