Variables in Python are names that refer to objects stored in memory. They act as containers for data values.

## Creating Variables

Variables are created when you assign a value to them - no declaration is needed:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

## Variable Naming Rules

**Must follow these rules:**
- Start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_)
- Contain only letters, numbers, and underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot use Python keywords (like `if`, `for`, `class`)

**Examples:**
```python
# Valid names
user_name = "John"
age2 = 30
_private = "hidden"
firstName = "Jane"

# Invalid names
# 2age = 30        # starts with number
# user-name = "x"  # contains hyphen
# class = "Math"   # Python keyword
```

## Variable Assignment

**Basic assignment:**
```python
x = 10
y = x  # y now refers to the same value as x
```

**Multiple assignment:**
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
x = y = z = 0  # all three variables get the same value
```

**Swapping variables:**
```python
a = 5
b = 10
a, b = b, a  # swap values
```

## Variable Scope

Variables have different scopes depending on where they're defined:

```python
global_var = "I'm global"

def my_function():
    local_var = "I'm local"
    print(global_var)  # can access global
    print(local_var)   # can access local

# print(local_var)  # Error: local_var not accessible here
```

## Dynamic Typing

Python variables can change type during runtime:

```python
x = 42        # x is an integer
x = "hello"   # now x is a string
x = [1, 2, 3] # now x is a list
```

## Variable Memory

Variables in Python are references to objects in memory. When you assign a variable, you're creating a reference to an object:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a  # b references the same list object as a
b.append(4)  # modifies the original list
print(a)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names: `student_count` instead of `sc`
- Use lowercase with underscores for variables: `user_name`
- Use UPPERCASE for constants: `PI = 3.14159`
- Avoid single-letter names except for short loops or mathematical expressions
