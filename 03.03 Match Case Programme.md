```
#day = "monday"
day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().lower()
# Using match-case statement to determine if it's a weekday or weekend

match day:
    case "monday" | "tuesday" | "wednesday" | "thursday" | "friday":
        print("Weekday")
    case "saturday" | "sunday":
        print("Weekend")
    case _:
        print("Invalid day")
```


## Explanation

That line of code, `day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().lower()`, is a great example of a common and powerful technique in Python called **method chaining**. It combines three different string methods to get a user-friendly and reliable input.

Let's break down each part step-by-step, working from the inside out (right to left):

### 1. `input("Enter a day of the week: ")`

* This is the standard `input()` function.
* It displays the prompt "Enter a day of the week: " to the user.
* It waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
* It then returns the user's input as a **string**.
* **Example:** If the user types `  Monday  ` (with spaces), this part returns the string `"  Monday  "`.

### 2. `.strip()`

* This is the `.strip()` **string method**.
* It is called on the string returned by the `input()` function.
* Its purpose is to **remove leading and trailing whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) from the string.
* This is crucial for preventing errors caused by accidental spaces. For example, if a user types `" Monday"`, the program will treat it as a different string than `"Monday"` without `.strip()`.
* **Example:** If the previous step returned `"  Monday  "`, applying `.strip()` will result in the string `"Monday"`.

### 3. `.lower()`

* This is the `.lower()` **string method**.
* It is called on the string returned by the `.strip()` method.
* Its purpose is to **convert all characters in the string to lowercase**.
* This makes the input **case-insensitive**, so "Monday", "MONDAY", and "monday" are all treated the same.
* **Example:** If the previous step returned `"Monday"`, applying `.lower()` will result in the string `"monday"`.

### Putting it All Together

By chaining these three methods together, you create a robust and clean way to get user input:

* The program prompts the user.
* The user's response is taken.
* Any extra spaces around the input are removed.
* The entire string is converted to lowercase.
* Finally, the resulting, clean string is assigned to the `day` variable.

This single line of code is a very efficient way to handle common user input issues and is highly recommended for building reliable programs that interact with users.
