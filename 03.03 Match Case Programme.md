```
#day = "monday"
day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().lower()
# Using match-case statement to determine if it's a weekday or weekend

match day:
    case "monday" | "tuesday" | "wednesday" | "thursday" | "friday":
        print("Weekday")
    case "saturday" | "sunday":
        print("Weekend")
    case _:
        print("Invalid day")
```


# Explanation

That line of code, `day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().lower()`, is a great example of a common and powerful technique in Python called **method chaining**. It combines three different string methods to get a user-friendly and reliable input.

Let's break down each part step-by-step, working from the inside out (right to left):

## 1. `input("Enter a day of the week: ")`

* This is the standard `input()` function.
* It displays the prompt "Enter a day of the week: " to the user.
* It waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
* It then returns the user's input as a **string**.
* **Example:** If the user types `  Monday  ` (with spaces), this part returns the string `"  Monday  "`.

##  2. `.strip()`

* This is the `.strip()` **string method**.
* It is called on the string returned by the `input()` function.
* Its purpose is to **remove leading and trailing whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) from the string.
* This is crucial for preventing errors caused by accidental spaces. For example, if a user types `" Monday"`, the program will treat it as a different string than `"Monday"` without `.strip()`.
* **Example:** If the previous step returned `"  Monday  "`, applying `.strip()` will result in the string `"Monday"`.

##  3. `.lower()`

* This is the `.lower()` **string method**.
* It is called on the string returned by the `.strip()` method.
* Its purpose is to **convert all characters in the string to lowercase**.
* This makes the input **case-insensitive**, so "Monday", "MONDAY", and "monday" are all treated the same.
* **Example:** If the previous step returned `"Monday"`, applying `.lower()` will result in the string `"monday"`.

### Putting it All Together

By chaining these three methods together, you create a robust and clean way to get user input:

* The program prompts the user.
* The user's response is taken.
* Any extra spaces around the input are removed.
* The entire string is converted to lowercase.
* Finally, the resulting, clean string is assigned to the `day` variable.

This single line of code is a very efficient way to handle common user input issues and is highly recommended for building reliable programs that interact with users.


In the `match-case` statement you provided, ` case _:  ` is a special pattern known as a **wildcard pattern** or **catch-all case**.

# What `case _:` Does

  * It acts as the **default** or **else** block of the `match-case` statement.
  * It will **match any value** that has not been matched by the preceding `case` statements.
  * The underscore `_` is a conventional variable name in Python used to indicate that you don't care about the value itself. It's a placeholder.

### How it Works in Your Program

Your `match-case` statement checks the value of the `day` variable against several patterns in a specific order:

1.  **`case "monday" | "tuesday" | ...`**: The program first checks if `day` is any of the weekday strings. If it matches, "Weekday" is printed, and the `match-case` block is exited.

2.  **`case "saturday" | "sunday"`**: If the first case did not match, the program then checks if `day` is either "saturday" or "sunday". If it matches, "Weekend" is printed, and the `match-case` block is exited.

3.  **`case _:`**: If the `day` variable **did not match any of the patterns above**, the `case _:` block is executed. This means the user entered something that is not a valid day of the week. In this case, "Invalid day" is printed.

### Analogy to `if-elif-else`

The `case _:` is the equivalent of the final `else` block in an `if-elif-else` chain.

Here is what the equivalent `if-elif-else` code would look like:

```python
if day == "monday" or day == "tuesday" or day == "wednesday" or day == "thursday" or day == "friday":
    print("Weekday")
elif day == "saturday" or day == "sunday":
    print("Weekend")
else:
    # This is the 'catch-all' or default behavior
    print("Invalid day")
```

Just like the `else` block, `case _:` ensures that the `match-case` statement always has a defined action for any possible input, preventing the program from doing nothing if an unexpected value is given. It makes your code more robust and complete.

##Simple Explanation:

This Python program determines whether a given day is a weekday or weekend using a **match-case statement** (introduced in Python 3.10).

Here's how it works:

**Input Processing:**
```python
day = input("Enter a day of the week: ").strip().lower()
```
- Takes user input for a day of the week
- `.strip()` removes any leading/trailing whitespace
- `.lower()` converts the input to lowercase for consistent comparison

**Match-Case Logic:**
The program uses pattern matching to categorize the day:

```python
match day:
    case "monday" | "tuesday" | "wednesday" | "thursday" | "friday":
        print("Weekday")
```
- The `|` operator acts as an OR condition
- If the day matches any of the five weekdays, it prints "Weekday"

```python
    case "saturday" | "sunday":
        print("Weekend")
```
- If the day is Saturday or Sunday, it prints "Weekend"

```python
    case _:
        print("Invalid day")
```
- The `_` is a wildcard that catches any input that doesn't match the previous cases
- Acts as a default case for invalid inputs

**Example Usage:**
- Input: "Monday" → Output: "Weekday"
- Input: "SATURDAY" → Output: "Weekend"  
- Input: "xyz" → Output: "Invalid day"

This approach is more readable than traditional if-elif statements and showcases Python's modern pattern matching capabilities.
