Nested functions, also known as inner functions, are functions defined inside another function in Python. This powerful feature allows for better code organization, encapsulation, and is fundamental to concepts like closures and decorators.

### How to Define a Nested Function

You simply use the `def` keyword inside another function's definition:

```python
def outer_function(message):
    print(f"Outer function received: {message}")

    def inner_function():
        # Inner function can access variables from the outer (enclosing) scope
        print(f"Inner function saying: {message}")

    # The inner function must be called from within the outer function
    inner_function()
    print("Outer function finished.")

# Call the outer function
outer_function("Hello from the outside!")
```

**Output:**

```
Outer function received: Hello from the outside!
Inner function saying: Hello from the outside!
Outer function finished.
```

### Key Characteristics and Use Cases

1.  **Encapsulation / Data Hiding:**

      * Inner functions are not directly accessible from the global scope. They are "hidden" within the outer function. This means they can serve as private helper functions that are only relevant to the outer function's logic.
      * This prevents cluttering the global namespace and makes your code more modular and less prone to naming conflicts.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def calculate_average(numbers):
        def sum_list(data):
            total = 0
            for item in data:
                total += item
            return total

        total_sum = sum_list(numbers) # inner_function is called here
        if len(numbers) > 0:
            return total_sum / len(numbers)
        else:
            return 0

    data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    avg = calculate_average(data)
    print(f"Average: {avg}")

    # Trying to call sum_list() directly would result in a NameError
    # print(sum_list([1, 2])) # NameError: name 'sum_list' is not defined
    ```

2.  **Accessing Enclosing Scope (Lexical Scoping):**

      * A crucial feature of nested functions is that they can access variables from their enclosing (outer) function's scope, even after the outer function has finished execution (this leads to closures, explained below).
      * This is part of Python's LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule for variable lookup.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def create_greeter(greeting_word):
        # greeting_word is in the enclosing scope
        def greet(name):
            return f"{greeting_word}, {name}!"
        return greet # Returns the inner function, not its result

    # create_greeter acts as a "factory" for greeter functions
    say_hello = create_greeter("Hello")
    say_hi = create_greeter("Hi")
    say_namaste = create_greeter("Namaste")

    print(say_hello("Alice"))
    print(say_hi("Bob"))
    print(say_namaste("Charlie"))
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```
    Hello, Alice!
    Hi, Bob!
    Namaste, Charlie!
    ```

3.  **Closures:**

      * A closure is a function object that remembers values in its enclosing scope even if those variables are no longer in memory (i.e., the outer function has finished executing).
      * The `create_greeter` example above is a classic demonstration of a closure. The `greet` function "closes over" the `greeting_word` variable from its creation context.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def make_multiplier(factor):
        def multiplier(number):
            return number * factor # 'factor' is remembered from the enclosing scope
        return multiplier

    double = make_multiplier(2)
    triple = make_multiplier(3)

    print(double(5)) # Output: 10
    print(triple(5)) # Output: 15
    ```

4.  **`nonlocal` Keyword:**

      * By default, an inner function can *read* variables from its enclosing scope. However, if you want to *modify* a variable from an immediately enclosing scope (not the global scope), you must use the `nonlocal` keyword.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def counter():
        count = 0 # This is in the enclosing scope

        def increment():
            nonlocal count # Declare 'count' as nonlocal to modify it
            count += 1
            return count
        return increment

    my_counter = counter() # my_counter is now the 'increment' function
    print(my_counter()) # Output: 1
    print(my_counter()) # Output: 2
    print(my_counter()) # Output: 3
    ```

5.  **Decorators:**

      * Nested functions are the backbone of Python decorators. Decorators are a powerful way to modify or enhance functions without changing their source code.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```python
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print("--- Something happening before the function call ---")
            result = func(*args, **kwargs) # Call the original function
            print("--- Something happening after the function call ---")
            return result
        return wrapper

    @my_decorator # This is syntactic sugar for say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
    def say_hello(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
        return f"Greetings to {name}"

    output = say_hello("Alice")
    print(f"Function output: {output}")
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```
    --- Something happening before the function call ---
    Hello, Alice!
    --- Something happening after the function call ---
    Function output: Greetings to Alice
    ```

### Why Use Nested Functions?

  * **Encapsulation:** Hides helper functions that are only relevant to the outer function's internal logic.
  * **Code Organization:** Groups related logic together, making the code more readable and maintainable.
  * **Closures:** Allows functions to remember and operate on variables from their creation environment, enabling functional programming patterns like factories for specialized functions.
  * **Decorators:** Provides a clean and powerful way to modify the behavior of other functions.
  * **Avoiding Global Variables:** Can reduce the need for global variables by allowing inner functions to access outer function's variables, promoting a more contained scope.

While nested functions offer many benefits, excessive nesting can sometimes make code harder to read. It's important to use them judiciously for logical grouping and specific design patterns like closures and decorators.
