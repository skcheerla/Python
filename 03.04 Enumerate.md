```
# Loop with index
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{i}: {fruit}")
```

This code iterates through a list of fruits and prints each fruit along with its index.

Let's break down the code line by line:

  * **`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]`**: This line creates a list named `fruits` that contains three strings: "apple", "banana", and "orange".

  * **`for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):`**: This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over the `fruits` list. The built-in function **`enumerate()`** is the key here. It provides both the index (`i`) and the value (`fruit`) for each item in the list as it goes through it.

  * **`print(f"{i}: {fruit}")`**: This line is inside the loop and gets executed for each item. It uses an **f-string** (formatted string literal) to print the output.

      * `{i}` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the current index (0, 1, and then 2).
      * `{fruit}` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the current fruit ("apple", "banana", and then "orange").

### The Output

When you run this code, it will produce the following output:

```
0: apple
1: banana
2: orange
```

This is a common and efficient way to loop through a list when you need to access both the item and its position.
