Operator Precedence in Python
In Python, operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. When you have an expression with multiple operators, Python follows a specific hierarchy to decide which operation to perform first.

Think of it like the "order of operations" you learned in math (PEMDAS/BODMAS), but for all types of operators in Python (arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.).

Understanding Operator Precedence
Consider the following Python expression:

Python

result = 10 - 5 + 3 * 2
Without knowing operator precedence, you might evaluate it from left to right:

10 - 5 = 5
5 + 3 = 8
8 * 2 = 16
However, Python actually evaluates it as:

3 * 2 = 6 (Multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction)
10 - 5 = 5 (Subtraction and addition have the same precedence, so they are evaluated from left to right)
5 + 6 = 11
So, the result will be 11.

Operator Precedence Rules (Similar to PEMDAS/BODMAS)
Python's operator precedence rules for arithmetic expressions are similar to the common mathematical acronyms like PEMDAS or BODMAS:

P - Parentheses (): Expressions inside parentheses are always evaluated first.
E - Exponentiation **: Exponents are evaluated next.
M - Multiplication *
D - Division /, //, % (floor division, modulo)
A - Addition +
S - Subtraction -
Important Note: Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, and Modulo operators have the same precedence. Similarly, Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence.

Associativity
When operators have the same precedence, associativity determines the order of evaluation.

Left-to-Right Associativity: Most Python operators (like +, -, *, /, //, %, comparison operators) are left-to-right associative. This means they are evaluated from left to right in the expression.

Example: 20 / 5 * 2
20 / 5 = 4.0
4.0 * 2 = 8.0
Right-to-Left Associativity: The exponentiation operator (**) is right-to-left associative.

Example: 2 ** 3 ** 2
3 ** 2 = 9
2 ** 9 = 512
What is an operator?
In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on operands (the values or variables the operators act upon). They are used to perform various computations and logical operations in Python programs.

Types of Operators
Python supports several types of operators, including:

Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **).
Comparison (Relational) Operators: Used to compare values (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=).
Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements (and, or, not).
Bitwise Operators: Used to perform operations on individual bits of numbers (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>).
Membership Operators: Used to test if a sequence is present in an object (in, not in).
Identity Operators: Used to compare the memory locations of two objects (is, is not).
Python Operator Precedence Table (Highest to Lowest)
Here's a more comprehensive table of Python operators, ordered from highest precedence to lowest:

Order	Operator Category	Operators
1	Parentheses	()
2	Exponentiation	**
3	Unary positive/negative	+x, -x
4	Multiplication, Division	*, /, //, %
5	Addition, Subtraction	+, -
6	Bitwise shifts	<<, >>
7	Bitwise AND	&
8	Bitwise XOR	^
9	Bitwise OR	`\
10	Comparisons	==, !=, >, >=, <, <=, is, is not, in, not in
11	Boolean NOT	not
12	Boolean AND	and
13	Boolean OR	or

Illustrative Example
Let's illustrate with an example that combines different types of operators:

Python

x = 5
y = 10
z = 2

# Example expression
result = x + y * z ** 2 > 50 and not (x == 5 or y < 10)
print(result)
Let's break down the evaluation step-by-step according to precedence:

z ** 2 (Exponentiation - highest precedence within arithmetic):
2 ** 2 = 4
The expression becomes: x + y * 4 > 50 and not (x == 5 or y < 10)

y * 4 (Multiplication):
10 * 4 = 40
The expression becomes: x + 40 > 50 and not (x == 5 or y < 10)

x + 40 (Addition):
5 + 40 = 45
The expression becomes: 45 > 50 and not (x == 5 or y < 10)

x == 5 and y < 10 (Comparisons - higher precedence than logical or and not):
5 == 5 = True
10 < 10 = False
The expression becomes: 45 > 50 and not (True or False)

True or False (Logical OR - inside parentheses, evaluated first):
True or False = True
The expression becomes: 45 > 50 and not True

not True (Logical NOT):
not True = False
The expression becomes: 45 > 50 and False

45 > 50 (Comparison):
45 > 50 = False
The expression becomes: False and False

False and False (Logical AND - lowest precedence among logical operators):
False and False = False

Therefore, print(result) will output False.

Key Takeaway:
Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct and predictable Python code. When in doubt, or to improve the clarity of complex expressions, always use parentheses () to explicitly define the order of operations. This makes your code easier to read and less prone to errors.
