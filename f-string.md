The "f" in a Python `print` statement, like `print(f"...")`, stands for **"formatted string literal"** or **f-string**.

F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and are a powerful and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals.

### How it works

An f-string starts with the letter `f` (or `F`) immediately before the opening quotation mark. Inside the string, you can place expressions inside curly braces `{}`. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and their results are inserted into the string.

### Example

Let's break down the example from before:

```python
age = 25
status = "adult"
print(f"The person's age is {age}, so their status is: {status}")
```

In this case:

  * The string starts with `f"`.
  * The expression `{age}` is found. Python looks up the value of the `age` variable (which is `25`) and inserts it into the string.
  * The expression `{status}` is found. Python looks up the value of the `status` variable (which is `"adult"`) and inserts it into the string.

The final output is:
`The person's age is 25, so their status is: adult`

### Key Advantages of F-strings

1.  **Readability:** They are much easier to read and write than older methods like `%` formatting or `str.format()`.
2.  **Conciseness:** You can directly embed variables and expressions without needing to list them separately.
3.  **Performance:** F-strings are generally faster than other string formatting methods.
4.  **Full Expression Support:** You can put any valid Python expression inside the curly braces, not just simple variables. For example:
      * `{age + 1}`
      * `{len(my_list)}`
      * `{my_function()}`
      * `{price * 1.18:.2f}` (for formatting numbers)
